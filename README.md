# HPC accelerated DeepLearning
## TODO


1 MultiLayer Perception Network

- Fully connected layer acceleration CUBLAS.
- Element-wise(activation) layers with cuDNN
- Softmax and loss functions in cuDNN/CUDA

2 Convolutional neural networks with cuDNN

3 Recurrent neural networks with CUDA
## Run Locally

Clone the project and Go to the project directory

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/pahuldeep/DeepLearningHPC.git
  cd deepLearningHPC
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  CUDA APIs etc, TO-DO.
```

Start the server/local

```bash
  I will update, TO-DO.
```
